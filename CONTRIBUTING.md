## Contributing to Mimik

Looking to contribute something to Mimik? **Here's how you can help.**

### Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Mimik. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** Someone else may have reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in Mimik's code with a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Include a live example.** Make use of jsFiddle or jsBin to share your isolated test cases.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version, version of Mimik. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

### Pull requests

- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
- Please squash your commits when appropriate. This simplifies future cherry picks, and also keeps the git log clean.
- Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it.
- Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, and the guides: whatever is affected by your contribution.
- If you can, have another developer sanity check your change.
